Note that this plugin automatically downloads and installs PyV8 binary (see status bar message). \n  \n  ******************************\n  Please restart editor \n  to finish installation process \n  after PyV8 was downloaded.\n  ******************************\n  \n  Tab key handler\n  ==========================\n  \n  By default, Emmet allows you to expand abbreviations with Tab key in HTML, XML, HAML and CSS/SASS/LESS/Stylus documents. As a side effect, you canâ€™t use some of your ST2 snippets.\n  \n  Please read https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime#tab-key-handler about how Tab handler works and how to tweak its behavior to match your needs.\n  \n  Enter key\n  ==========================\n  \n  In HTML and XML documents, Emmet overrides Enter key to insert formatted line breaks between opening and closing tags. In some cases it will break character input (for example, in Japanese language).\n  \n  To disable Enter key handler, simply add the following option in your user's Preferences file:\n  \n  \"disable_formatted_linebreak\": true\n  \n  Actions shortcuts\n  ==========================\n  \n  Emmet has a number of actions with keyboard shortcuts that may override ones you're using commonly (for example, Ctrl-E or Ctrl-Down). Please read the project main page to get list of available actions and keyboard shortcuts and how to disable them:\n  https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime\n  \n  Documentation and examples:\n  http://emmet.io\n  \n  ------------------------------\n  Follow me on Twitter: @emmetio\n  ------------------------------\n\n\nSublimeCodeIntel\n----------------\n\n  SublimeCodeIntel\n  ================\n  \n   ____        _     _ _                 ____          _      ___       _       _\n  / ___| _   _| |__ | (_)_ __ ___   ___ / ___|___   __| | ___|_ _|_ __ | |_ ___| |\n  \\___ \\| | | | '_ \\| | | '_ ` _ \\ / _ \\ |   / _ \\ / _` |/ _ \\| || '_ \\| __/ _ \\ |\n   ___) | |_| | |_) | | | | | | | |  __/ |__| (_) | (_| |  __/| || | | | ||  __/ |\n  |____/ \\__,_|_.__/|_|_|_| |_| |_|\\___|\\____\\___/ \\__,_|\\___|___|_| |_|\\__\\___|_|\n  A full-featured code intelligence and smart autocomplete engine for Sublime Text.\n     (Code intelligence plugin ported from Open Komodo Editor to Sublime Text)\n  \n  \n  +-------------------------------- HELP WANTED ---------------------------------+\n  |     Maintaining this project is hard, I do it in my spare time, but I'm      |\n  |     basically all alone.

Your changes will be lost\n  when SublimeCodeIntel is updated. ALWAYS edit the user SublimeCodeIntel settings\n  by selecting \"Preferences->Package Settings->SublimeCodeIntel->Settings - User\".\n  Note that individual settings you include in your user settings will **completely**\n  replace the corresponding default setting, so you must provide that setting in its entirety.\n\n\nSFTP\n----\n\n  Thanks for installing Sublime SFTP! Below are some quick notes to get you\n  started with the plugin. Please see https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp for\n  the full documentation.\n  \n  \n  There are two major modes of operation:\n  1. Mapping a local folder to a remote folder\n  2. Working off of a server\n  \n  \n  Mapping a Local Folder to a Remote Folder\n  ----\n  \n  To map a local folder to a remote folder, right-click on it in the side bar\n  and select the SFTP/SFTP > Map to Remote... You will enter your connection\n  parameters and a new file will be created named sftp-config.json.\n  \n  Once this file has been saved, all files in that folder and all subfolders\n  will have various operations available via the side bar context menu, editor\n  context menu and command palette.\n  \n  \n  Working off of a Server\n  ----\n  \n  To work off of a server, use the File menu and select SFTP/FTP > Setup Server...\n  You will enter your connection parameters and options then save the file with\n  the name you want to give the connection.\n  \n  Once the server config is saved, you will be automatically connected to the\n  server and you can browse and perform actions via the quick panel.\n  \n  Unfortunely due to limitations of the Sublime Text API, it is not possible\n  to present the remote filesystem in the side bar. There are, however, key\n  bindings for connecting to servers to help reduce the amount of time remote\n  file operations take.\n  \n  \n  Support\n  ----\n  \n  To learn more about the features and settings, please visit\n  https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp.\n  \n  If you are having trouble, please visit\n  https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp/support. The support page includes\n  instructions for capturing a debug log that will be useful if you believe\n  you are experiencing a bug.\n",
